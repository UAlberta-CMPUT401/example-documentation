Project Glossary Attempt An attempt is one data entry recorded from the procedure and assigned to an experiment. Common Attribute - A common attribute is a data column that all subjects have initially. It is pre-defined by the researcher\u2019s data files that the robots create. Custom Attribute - A custom attribute is a user defined data column that does not already exist in the researcher's data files created by the robots. Experiment - An experiment is the collection of subjects and the attempts they have done for a scientific procedure. An example is \u201cSpinal Damage Recovery Experiment (SDRE).\u201d Researcher - A researcher manages the experiments and subjects. They can upload data, add custom attributes, query data, and export their results to an external CSV file. Result - A result is the returned attempts from a search query on some experiments. Results can be exported as an external CSV file. Subject - A subject is an animal used as part of an experiment. Each subject will have a unique ID. User Stories US 1.01 - Authentication As a User, I want to authenticate with my University of Alberta account, so that I can get access to the app's functionalities. Acceptance Tests Login as user with correct information Input incorrect information and make sure it doesn't allow the user to continue US 1.02 - View Tasks As a User, I want to be able to see events/surveys/quizzes that are currently going on for the week, so that I can attend theses events if I choose to. Acceptance Tests User should be able to see all of the events in a list as well as all of the surveys and quizzes if they choose to. US 1.03 - View Profile As a User, I want to be able to view my profile, so that I can see my level, points, my history of attending events, surveys and quizzes. Acceptance Tests Need to ensure the button in the drop-down menu will open. When the profile button is clicked, it will take me to my profile. User input is their specific user data.
